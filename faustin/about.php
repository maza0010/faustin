                <p>My name is Faustin Kibukila ,Pastor and founder of The Pentecostal community church of Ottawa and Gatineau. </p>
                <p>God has called me to serve him since my childhood. I started preaching and singing at age six in a small church, 
                    in a small village called Kailenge /Pinga in Walikale Territory ,province of North Kivu in DRC /Congo</p>
                <p>In 1992 I was Anointed as an Evangelist in our Parish of 8 ieme CEPAC Mutakato/Goma. God used me in preaching, 
                    meantime I was the choir leader in my home church -Kailenge and a choir Member in Tumaini Center -one church among those from Mutakato Mission
                </p>
                <p>In 1995 I married my lovely wife and my partner of life Jacqueline Kibukila . God had been using me as a singer in choirs during that time. 
                    I managed to initiate a youth choir/band composed by young boys the name of the band was  << La joie du salut >> which translates to “ The Joy Of Salvation ” 
                    from that time God inspired me to compose my very first song which wa ; ZAKAYO {Yesu alipoingia na kupita yeriko …..] this was a song about zacchaeus 
                    from the Holy scriptures/Bible. I then became a song writer for two choirs <<Tumaini Choirs and La joie du salut>> </p>
                <p>I then began writing songs regularly, following is a short list of the order of my compositions: Maisha yako ewe mwanadamu, 
                    Bwana ndiye muchungaji, nitayainua macho yangu, Recherchez la paix and much more.
                </p>
                <p>In 2000 I moved to Kenya . In Kenya I continued to be a choir Master in a church called Church on the Rock-Mwimuto and preacher at the same time. 
                    In 2002 I got appointed to be an assistant pastor of WCG KAngemi Church, Where God has been using us in intercessory prayers and evangelical Missions. 
                    In the same year I got the chance to do my first album entitled KILA KINGAACHO SIO DHAHABU.</p>
                <p>I am still on my journey to meet with the King, and pray that the He continues to strengthen me so that one day </p>
                <h5>God has inspired me and now I have six albums ready which are ;</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Kila kingaacho sio dhahabu</li>
                    <li>REcherchez la paix avec tous</li>
                    <li>Nani kama wewe </li>
                    <li>Utajiri wangu ni yesu</li>
                    <li>Bwana ndiye mchungaji wangu</li>
                    <li>Jesus ma puissance</li>
                </ul>
